# To-Do List Project

Welcome to my ‘To-Do List’ project repository. This project is a part of my journey in mastering web development and showcases my skills in creating interactive and user-friendly applications.

The ‘To-Do List’ is a simple yet powerful application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks that are no longer needed. The application is designed with a focus on usability and simplicity, making it easy for users to stay organized and productive.

This project is built using HTML, TailWind CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating my proficiency in these technologies. It also incorporates best practices in web development, including clean and maintainable code, responsive design, and user-friendly interfaces.

I believe in the power of open-source and collaborative learning. Therefore, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions. If you have any ideas or improvements, feel free to make a pull request.

Stay organized, stay productive!
